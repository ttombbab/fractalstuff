I was working on fractal compression when i came up wuth this mathmatical space using a real,imag,imag )see newnum.py) number and the iterative formula for multibrots (z+z**5 + c) usally to the fifth power. whem the results of these cacculations are progected to two dimentions the paterns are very much like real world images (a pomigranet seed for example). I coulden't get from an image  to how to assign a fractal space ad so i put it o the back burer. recetly i was listeig to a video abught recostructing datasets froom neral net weights and i was inspired. I was thinking that maybe I could treat the multi-julia set attractors as weights in a neural net work and then reconcruct the data from that.
